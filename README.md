Domain Generation with Hybrid CNN-LSTM Neural Networks
Overview

This repository contains materials related to the domain name generation project using hybrid CNN-LSTM neural networks. In this project, we explore how these networks can generate domain names similar to normal domains and evaluate their effectiveness in detecting algorithmically generated domains (AGD).
Contents

    Code: Folder containing Jupyter notebooks used for training and evaluating domain name generation models.
    Doc: Folder including documents and files related to the project, such as reports, presentations, and any other relevant material.
    Data: Folder that contain datasets generet in the project.
    Models: Folder containing the neural network models developed for domain name generation.
